My linter for latest Node.js

You do not want this module, it will impose use of features only available in
the very latest Node.js releases.  You should consider using [xo] instead.
This module may introduce breaking changes without a semver-major bump.  Bug
reports and PR's are likely to be closed unless I personally agree with
proposed the change.
